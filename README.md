I am Tahsin Mayeesha. I'm working as a researcher focused on NLP, HCI and AI policymaking. Currently, I am diving into exciting new challenges at EBLICT-Dream71 joint collaboration on Bangla VPA (Virtual Private Assistant) project funded by the Bangladesh government where we build Llama based RAG models for making public administration related information accessible to citizens.

Prior to this role, I worked as a HCI researcher for a year in Design,Inclusion & Access Lab(DIAL) in North South University with my superviser Dr. Nova Ahmed in multiple projects in education and AI policy-making. The key projects are 1)"My Freedom in Light", where we investigated challenges of women in computing with fictional inquiry and co-design workshop faciliating participatory design from female students in computer science, and 2) "Designing Accountable and Ethical AI for the Next Billions: Considering the Needs of South Asian Marginalized Communities" - where we studied current state of AI ethics related policies and perspectives with a focus on South Asia and Bangladesh . Publications from these projects have been accepted to ICTD 2024, ACM Compass 2024 and Ubicomp 2024.

Simultaneously, I worked on NLP research as a senior research assistant with supervision of Dr. M. Rashedur Rahman in the project "Bengali NLP : Application in Literature and Natural Language Generation" on multiple topics including answer-aware question generation from passages, and generating questions with/without guidance from images. I also finished a predoctoral fellowship in Fatima Fellowship on a NLP project with mentor Benjamin Muller on investigating cultural biases like formality in multilingual generative models. Publications from these projects were accepted to journals and NLP Conferences (EMNLP 2023, MM-NLG Workshop held with INLG 2023).

I've graduated from Computer Science and Engineering (North South University) in 2020. My thesis project was on building deep learning models for question answering systems in Bengali where I trained multilingual BERT models on synthetic data. During my undergrad I worked with Tensorflow Hub team for Google Summer of Code 2019 with mentor Vojtech Bardiovsk√Ω, Berkman Klein Center of Internet and Society with mentor Hal Roberts for Google Summer of Code 2018 and Cramstack in 2017.

When I am not immersed in research, I enjoy watching anime, reading manga or books, and taking care of my cats.üêà‚Äç‚¨õ
