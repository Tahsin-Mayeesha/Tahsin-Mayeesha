<h1 align="center">Hi 👋, I'm Tahsin-Mayeesha</h1>

CHi! I am currently working as a researcher in NSU HCI DIAL(Design and Inclusion) Lab on a Google funded project to research on education related barriers and challenges of South Asian women in computing. Concurrently I'm also managing 3 Bengali NLP projects on generative models in the domain of Question Answering research as a senior Research Assistant. I have worked as a predoctoral fellow in Fatima Fellowship on a NLP project with mentor Benjamin Muller on investigating cultural biases such as formality in multilingual generative models. My papers have been accepted to EMNLP Findings, ACM Compass and multiple journal and workshops recently. 

During my undergrad at North South University (NSU) in Bangladesh, I got into research when I was advised by Dr Nova Ahmed and Prof. Rashedur M Rahman. I've graduated from Computer Science and Engineering major (North South University) in Fall 2020. My thesis project was on building deep learning models for question answering systems in Bengali where I trained multilingual BERT models on synthetic data. My research experience has so far been around NLP, AI Ethics/Policy and HCI.

Previously I’ve worked with Tensorflow Hub team for Google Summer of Code 2019 with mentor Vojtech Bardiovský, Berkman Klein Center of Internet and Society with mentor Hal Roberts for Google Summer of Code 2018 and Cramstack in 2017.
