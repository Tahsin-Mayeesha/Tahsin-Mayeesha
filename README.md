<h1 align="center">Hi 👋, I'm Tahsin-Mayeesha</h1>

Currently, I'm working as a research assistant in North South University in the project "Bengali NLP: Application in Literature and Natural Language Generation" for bengali question generation and answering. I've recently collaborated on multiple AI ethics related projects for global south. 

In 2022 I finished a remote predoctoral program Fatima Fellowship for research on analyzing cultural biases in multilingual pretrained models. Before that I worked with Pi School of AI as an AI Fellow with the sponsor company Translated on language identification for multilingual sentences. Previously I worked in NSU HCI DIAL Lab, project Alor Akash as a data scientist to analyze sentiment from qualitative research interview transcripts. 

I've graduated from Computer Science and Engineering major (North South University) in Fall 2020. My thesis project was on building deep learning models for question answering systems in Bengali where I trained multilingual BERT models on synthetic data. My technical interests are mostly around deep learning, NLP and speech. During my school years I’ve worked with Tensorflow Hub team for Google Summer of Code 2019, Berkman Klein Center of Internet and Society(research lab in Harvard) for Google Summer of Code 2018 and Cramstack(Bangladeshi ML consulting startup) in 2017.
